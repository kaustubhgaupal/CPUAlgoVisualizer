# CPUSchedulerAI 🚀

A powerful, interactive **CPU Scheduling Simulator** combined with an **AI-powered Teaching Assistant**.

This project helps students and developers visualize how operating systems schedule processes (like FCFS, Round Robin, SJF) and provides a real-time **AI Chatbot** (powered by Google Gemini) to explain concepts, answer questions, and analyze scheduling logic.
